# HummingbirdXCT AsyncHTTPClient

Test client for Hummingbird server framework that uses the swift server [AsyncHTTPClient](https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client) as its test client instead of the internal test client Hummingbird provides.

Use this if you want to test things like TLS and HTTP2.
